A simple Chrome extension that reminds you how long it has been since your last commit
to a (public) github repository. Good for people still learning (like me!) to keep their
motivation up!

Installation:
```
Download this repo using the green 'clone or download' button in the top right.
Navigate to chrome://extensions
Tick the 'Developer Mode' checkbox
click "Load Unpacked Extension"
Navigate to where this repo was downloaded
The extension should now load into your browser
```
